Adding two integers is an example where only the best solution will do. Having just and approximate solution in computations with many additions would result
in big deviations from the true answer (i.e. we would eventually get a very
very bad approximation).

An approximate solution could be acceptable when looking for the shortest-path
from home to work, after all it is more important to actually get to work.
