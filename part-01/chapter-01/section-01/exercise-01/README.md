Sorting:

* words and phrases in book indexes are sorted lexicographically
* words in dictionaries are also sorted lexicographically
* information presented in tables could be sorted on different columns
  (e.g. Excel tables)

Convex hull:

* collision detection between complex objects could be done using their convex
  hulls to weed out not colliding objects
