*Array* is a collection of fixed number of elements, each identified by an
index - number from $0$ to $n - 1$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the
array.

Strengths:

* sequential in memory (cache friendly)
* $\mathcal{O}(1)$ random access
* no additional memory

Limitations:

* cannot insert/delete elements
