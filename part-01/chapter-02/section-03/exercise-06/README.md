The goal of this **while** loop is to find the place where $A[j]$ should stand
and accommodate place for it, i.e., shift all scanned elements to the right by
$1$. By using binary search, we could find the place of $A[j]$ in
$\Theta(\lg{n})$ time, but the shifting would still be linear, causing a
worst-case running time of $\Theta(n^{2})$.
